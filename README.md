ðŸ§  Deep Learning Projects with TensorFlow
This repository contains two beginner-friendly deep learning projects built using TensorFlow and Keras, designed to demonstrate core concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

ðŸ“Œ Projects Included
1. Text Classification with TensorFlow
Implements a basic NLP pipeline using Keras.

Covers preprocessing, tokenization, embedding, and training a classifier.

Useful for sentiment analysis, spam detection, etc.

2. Object Detection using CNN (Simulated Data)
Trains a CNN to both classify digits and predict bounding boxes on synthetic 28Ã—28 grayscale images.

Demonstrates multi-output models and IoU-based evaluation.

Includes visualization of predictions vs. actual bounding boxes.
